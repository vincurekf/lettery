# TODO
- check if given letter (string) is a word (length > 1) and then act upon it, so defining "words: true" wont be necessary and plugin will know that it's word that is being processed.
- add possibility to add hover/click popup to word
- add possibility to check whether or not is given letter followed by space to prevent editting words at the end of word
- add possibility to assign class to currently processed letter/word and update DOM (to let the generated <span> be affected)
